Protector urban planning mod [protect]

Protector redo for minetest is a mod that protects a players builds by placing
a block that stops other players from digging or placing blocks in that area.

based on glomie's mod, remade by Zeg9 and reworked by TenPlus1. Urban planning features added by rnd.


Released under WTFPL

Urban planning features:
- set up several centers around which placing protectors is costly ( requires upgrade )
- upon placing/digging protectors a network of protectors is built and counts of all nearby protectors is updated
- if certain protector count is exceeded in the network placing new protectors requires upgrade. If protector is placed far away from
	existing network new network is formed with its own count
- protector requiring upgrade does not add to protection ( it obstructs it, since it has no owner ), but it can be dug up by anyone.
- upon upgrade ( paying it with enough mese crystals ) the ownership is assigned to player who completed upgrade

INSTALLATION: extract into directory called "protector" inside minetest mod directory
